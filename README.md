# Stata/IC/15 - integration for Linux
A Linux script to add menu entries and file associations for an already installed **Stata-IC 15** instance into the desktop environment for a convenient access to the software, it can be useful for end-users running Linux as Stata does not install/configure menu entries and file associations in a Linux desktop environment during installation. 

The script has been tested in Debian 9 with the latest **Stata 15**. And should work in some other distros as well. 

## Usage
Run `integrate-stata-menu.sh` in a terminal window in order to configure proper menu entries & mime type associations for the already installed Stata/IC 15.
